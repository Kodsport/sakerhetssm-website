To communicate using TCP, you need two computers, one server and one client. Once a connection has been established between two computer they can speak freely between each other. This connection is not encrypted, so in order to encrypt it the TLS protocol is often used over TCP. In many challenges in this competition, we will ask you to connect to an IP address and port using TLS. One such example can be found below. The IP address identifies the computer we are connecting to and the port specifies which service on that computer we want to talk to.\n\nOn many Linux systems you will find the tool <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">netcat</span> pre-installed, however this tool does usually not support TLS. We recommend installing the very similar tool <code>ncat</code> which can be used to create a TLS connection directly to an IP address and port and communicate over the internet. On Linux <code>ncat</code> can usually be installed using your package manager, while on Windows and macOS it is available to download from <a href=\"https://nmap.org/ncat/\">Nmap</a>. Try connecting to the IP address and port listed in this challenge description (displayed on the following format: <code>ncat --ssl &lt;ip&gt; &lt;port&gt;</code>) by copying that command and running it in the terminal.
